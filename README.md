# Clean-Samples

Like Dirt-Samples, but cleaned up, with clear provenance and license
(generally CC0 but check the folder for specifics).

The [bin/meta.py](bin/meta.py) python script is a reference
implementation that can make a '.cleanmeta' metadata file for your
sample pack folder. Run it without parameters for help.

See [example_pack](example_pack/] for an example sample pack.
