# Clean-Samples

Like Dirt-Samples, but cleaned up, with clear provenance and license
(generally CC0 but check the metadata for specifics).

The [bin/meta.py](bin/meta.py) python script is a reference
implementation that can make a '.cleanmeta' metadata file for your own
sample pack folder. Run it without parameters for help. To contribute
your pack to Clean-Samples quark, please package it separately and
then submit a PR adding it to dependencies listed in the
Clean-Samples.quark. It would be a good idea to prefix your sampleset
with `Clean-`, e.g. `Clean-303bass`, but this isn't mandatory.

If you want to use these outside the supercollider quark ecosystem you
are very welcome. You're encouraged to discuss this in the github
issue tracker so that we can develop a standard way to share and
index/signpost these packs.

See [example_pack](example_pack/) for an example sample pack.
